# Patient Re-admission Prediction Using CRISP-DM in IBM SPSS Modeler

This project applies the CRISP-DM methodology to predict patient re-admissions using a diabetes dataset. The analysis and modeling were conducted using IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0.

## 📌 Objective

To develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days, using historical patient data related to diabetes.

## 🔍 Methodology - CRISP-DM

1. **Business Understanding**: Reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes by identifying patients at risk of re-admission.
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore and assess the diabetes dataset, check for missing values and class imbalances.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean the dataset, transform variables, encode categorical values, and handle missing data.
4. **Modeling**: Use IBM SPSS Modeler to apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression) to train and evaluate models.
5. **Evaluation**: Analyze model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Deployment**: (Optional) Insights can be used by healthcare professionals for intervention planning.
